## Philosophy

Why reinvent the wheel and make yet another video editor? Simple: video editors are designed to be powerful and flexible, but innovation in regards to workflow has well nigh stagnated over the years. Most video editors have a very similar workflow and layout, with minor variations but the same generic "video editor" base.

After having used numerous different video editors over the years, I've come to realize that the normal video editor workflow is inherently inefficient. Much of the work has to be done by slow point-and-click mouse operations, while constantly switching between using the mouse to navigate and the keyboard to enter values, tweak parameters, or use shortcuts. Any mouse-based interface is inherently inefficient due to the imprecise nature of mouse navigation. Misclicking is a frustration that everyone is familiar with.

The solution? Make a video editor workflow where everything can be done in just a few keystrokes, almost entirely from your keyboard. Take all common operations, such as making cuts, adding clips, applying transforms & animations to clips, and optimize the video editor for these operations. Add in lots of helpful keyboard shortcuts for common tasks, and ensure that the number of steps **and transitions between keyboard and mouse** are kept to a **minimum** for all of these tasks. Keep everything in a single window and use on-the-spot popups and context menus when necessary to reduce mouse travel.

The end goal is to have a video editor designed entirely with the end user in mind. Yes, a video editor needs to be fast and powerful and flexible. But that doesn't mean it has to be a pain to use. All tasks should be quick, easy, and intuitive for the end user.

The purpose of FlowCut is to change video editing from being a struggle to a joy.
